## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** — The automation is initiated via the Appilot dashboard, where users set up their preferred reply templates, rules, and account credentials.  
2. **Core Logic** — Appilot interacts with the Amazon Seller app using UI Automator and Accessibility APIs to read messages, detect intents, and send appropriate responses.  
3. **Output or Action** — The bot automatically sends replies, processes refund actions, and logs the outcomes in structured reports.  
4. **Other Functionalities** — Integrated error handling, retry logic, and multi-threaded execution ensure continuous and stable performance even during high message volume.
